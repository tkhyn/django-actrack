django-actrack
==============

|copyright| 2014-2020 Thomas Khyn

``django-actrack`` is an activity tracker for the Django framework. It enables
recording any activity by any actor, relative to any number of targets or
related objects, with or without additional data. The activity can then be
retrieved through feeds associated to any instance linked to any action(s).

It has been tested with Django 2.2.* and 3.0.* and their matching Python versions (3.5 to 3.8).
